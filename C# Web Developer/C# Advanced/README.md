# C# Advanced Module

This folder contains various task solutions for the **`C# Advanced`** and **`C# OOP`** Courses at **[Software University](https://softuni.bg/)**.

# C# Advanced

**`C# Advanced`** course examines the **`.NET`** platform as well as the **`C#`** programming language. It teaches how to create custom linear data structures, develops problem solving skills and algorithmic thinking through practice expressed in solving diverse tasks. It also covers the work with streams, files and directories and shows the process of creating template classes. Attention is drawn to the functional programming paradigm, as well as to the main tool relying on it - LINQ for processing data streams.

**Acquired Skills** :
* Working with multidimensional and associative data structures
* Application of basic algorithms
* Working with data streams, files and directories
* Creating custom linear data structures
* Application of functional programming
* Creating template classes

# C# OOP

**`C# OOP`** course teaches the main principles of Object-Oriented Programming **`OOP`** - Abstraction (Interfaces, Abstract classes), Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism, working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling and building class hierarchies. Adherence to the five **`SOLID`** principles (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion), look through the most commonly used design patterns, component testing (Unit Tests), the concept of Test-Driven Development **`TDD`**, using Reflection and events.
