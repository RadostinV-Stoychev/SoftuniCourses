# C# DB Module

This folder contains various task solutions for the **`Database Basics - MS SQL Server`** and **`Entity Framework Core`** Courses at **[Software University](https://softuni.bg/)**.

# MS SQL

Databases are the standard way of using dynamic information in modern technology, making them an integral part of almost any application. This course introduces us to one of the most widely used Database Management Systems **`DBMS`**, used in the development of modern information systems - **`Microsoft SQL Server`**.

**`Database Basics with MS SQL Server`** course pays serious attention to the relational model, modeling of data with ER diagrams (tables and relational links), and the use of **`SQL`** language (Data Extraction, Selection, Projection, Connections, Aggregation, Grouping, Modification, Deletion and Insertion).
It gives basic knowledge of working with **`ACID`** transactions and transactional processing, as well as practical performance tuning tips. It lays the foundation for working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and understanding concepts like turning a database into an Object-Oriented Model **`ORM`**.

# Entity Framework Core

**`Entity Framework Core`** course looks in detail the work with ORM technology - **`Entity Framework Core (EF Core)`**, which is the standard for ORM in C# and .NET Core applications. **`EF Core`** enables mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model using the **`Database First`** and **`Code First`** approaches, and provides a powerful object-oriented API for database queries and **`CRUD`** operations. The course shows best practices and architectures for building a database layer on complex systems using the **`Repository`** and **`Unit of Work`** templates.

* Building a database architecture
* Using the "**Database First**" approach
* Working with a database using ORM
* Using the "**Code First**" approach
* Extracting data with LINQ queries
