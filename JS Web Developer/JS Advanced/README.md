Teaches more complex concepts such as **`Function Context`**, **`Explicit Binding`**, **`Event Loop`**. Develops problem solving skills and algorithmic thinking through practice expressed in solving diverse tasks. Covers the work with **`DOM tree`**, it's manipulation and handling events. Attention is drawn to the Functional and Object-Oriented Programming paradigms. Concepts such as **`Inheritance`**, **`Object Composition`** and **`Prototype Chaining`** are covered as well.

# JS Applications

**`JS Applications`** course teaches what **`HTTP`** requests are and how to use them, what **`Unit Testing`** is and what are the basic techniques for testing code. It gives in-depth understanding of **`REST Services`**, what a **`Baas (Back-end as a service)`** is and how to work with it, what **`Asynchronous code`** means (**`Promises`**, using **`async/await`**), what **`Templating`** and **`Routing`** are. Shows what is **`Application Architecture`** and how to properly structure web applications. It also looks through different **`Design Templates`** and their practical direction, creating **`Custom Web Components`** using the Web Components standard and raise a **`Webpack`** environment from scratch. The learned techniques give the opportunity to create **`Single-Page Applications`**, written entirely in **`JavaScript`**, using databases as a ready-made service (**`Firebase Realtime Database`** and **`Firestore`**).
